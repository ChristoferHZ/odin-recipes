    <li>1/2 cup of tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of crumbled blue cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of shredded provolone cheese</li>

    <h3 style="font-size:30px">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
<ol> 
    <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you're using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up as well.</li>
    <li>Sauté the Aromatics: Add the chopped onion and garlic to the pot. Sauté for about 5 minutes until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the Sauce: Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the pizza dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
    <li>Add the Cheeses: Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese evenly over the tomato sauce. Next, add the crumbled blue cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and shredded provolone cheese.</li>
    <li>Add the Broth: Pour in the vegetable broth, making sure all the vegetables are submerged. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
    <li>Season: Drizzle the olive oil over the top of the pizza and sprinkle with dried oregano.</li>
    <li>Bake the Pizza: Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (or onto the pizza stone if using). Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheeses are melted and bubbly.</li>
    <li>Garnish and Serve: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired. Slice and serve hot.</li>
