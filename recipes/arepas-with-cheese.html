    <h2>Crispy arepas with cheese</h2>

<ul>
    <li>2 cups of pre-cooked cornmeal (such as P.A.N. or Masarepa)</li>
    <li>2 1/2 cups of warm water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of vegetable oil or butter (optional)</li>
    <li>Additional oil or butter for cooking</li>
    
</ul>

<ol> 
    <li>Heat the Oil: In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Sauté the Aromatics: Add the chopped onion and garlic to the pot. Sauté for about 5 minutes until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the Vegetables: Add the carrots, celery, potatoes, zucchini, and broccoli to the pot. Stir well to combine with the onions and garlic.</li>
    <li>Cook the Vegetables: Sauté the vegetables for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they start to soften.</li>
    <li>Add the Broth: Pour in the vegetable broth, making sure all the vegetables are submerged. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
    <li>Simmer: Reduce the heat to low and let the soup simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until all the vegetables are tender.</li>
    <li>Blend the Soup: Use an immersion blender to puree the soup directly in the pot until smooth. Alternatively, you can transfer the soup in batches to a blender and blend until smooth. Be careful with the hot liquid.</li>
    <li>Add the Cream: Return the pureed soup to the pot if you used a blender. Stir in the heavy cream until well combined.</li>
    <li>Season: Taste the soup and add salt and pepper as needed.</li>
    <li>Garnish and Serve: Ladle the hot soup into bowls. Garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or thyme. Serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
